;;; Commentary:

;; Open a buffer with file/lines of exact-match tags shown.  Select one by
;; going to a line and pressing return.  pop-tag-mark still works with this
;; code.
;;
;; If there is only one match, you can skip opening the selection window by
;; setting a custom variable.  This means you could substitute the key binding
;; for find-tag-at-point with etags-select-find-tag-at-point, although it
;; won't play well with tags-loop-continue.  On the other hand, if you like
;; the behavior of tags-loop-continue you probably don't need this code.
;;
;; I use this:
;; (global-set-key "\M-?" 'etags-select-find-tag-at-point)
;; (global-set-key "\M-." 'etags-select-find-tag)
