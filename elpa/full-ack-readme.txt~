;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/full-ack")
;; (autoload 'ack-same "full-ack" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack "full-ack" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack-find-same-file "full-ack" nil t)
;; (autoload 'ack-find-file "full-ack" nil t)
;;
;; Run `ack' to search for all files and `ack-same' to search for files of the
;; same type as the current buffer.
;;
;; `next-error' and `previous-error' can be used to jump to the matches.
;;
;; `ack-find-file' and `ack-find-same-file' use ack to list the files in the
;; current project.  It's a convenient, though slow, way of finding files.
